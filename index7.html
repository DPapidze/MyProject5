<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</p> <br> <br>
<b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
<p> <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <mark>1500s</mark>, when an unknown printer took a galley of
type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
<p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <mark>1960s</mark> with the release of Letraset
sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <b><s>Aldus PageMaker</s></b>
including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>
